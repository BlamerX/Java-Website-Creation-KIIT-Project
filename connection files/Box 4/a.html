    <h1 class="title">Buffer Class Reader</h1>
    <p>The BufferedReader class of Java is used to read the stream of characters from the specified source
        (character-input
        stream). The constructor of this class accepts an InputStream object as a parameter.</p>
    <p>This class provides a method named <b><i>read()</i></b> and <b><i>readLine()</i></b> which reads and returns the
        character and next line from
        the
        source (respectively) and returns them.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Instantiate an <b>InputStreamReader</b> class bypassing your InputStream object as a parameter.</li>
        <li>Then, create a BufferedReader, bypassing the above obtained InputStreamReader object as a parameter.</li>
        <li>Now, read data from the current reader as String using the readLine() or read() method.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 id="working">Working of BufferedReader</h2>
    <p>The BufferedReader maintains an internal <b> buffer of 8192 characters.</b></p>

    <p>During the read operation in BufferedReader, a chunk of characters is read from the disk and stored in the
        internal
        buffer. And from the internal buffer characters are read individually.</p>
    <p>Hence, the number of communication to the disk is reduced. This is why reading characters is faster using
        BufferedReader.</p>

    <h2 id="Scanner-vs-BuffredReader">Difference Between Scanner and BufferedReader Class in Java</h2>

    <p>In Java, Scanner and BufferedReader class are sources that serve as ways of reading inputs. Scanner class is a
        simple
        text scanner that can parse primitive types and strings. It internally uses regular expressions to read
        different types
        while on the other hand BufferedReader class reads text from a character-input stream, buffering characters so
        as to
        provide for the efficient reading of the sequence of characters</p>
    <p>The eccentric difference lies in reading different ways of taking input via the next() method that is justified
        in the
        below programs over the similar input set.</p>
    <p>eg :-</p>
    <pre style="width: 20cm;"><code>
        import java.io.*;
        
        // Main class
        class Main {
        
            // Main driver method
            public static void main(String args[])throws IOException{
        
                // Creating object of class inside main() method
                BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(
                new InputStreamReader(System.in));
        
                System.out.println("Enter an integer");
        
                // Taking integer input
                int a = Integer.parseInt(br.readLine());
        
                System.out.println("Enter a String");
        
                String b = br.readLine();
        
                // Printing input entities above
                System.out.printf("You have entered:- " + a + " and name as " + b);
            }
        }
                
                </code></pre>
    <br>

    <pre style="background-color: black;width: 13cm;"><code style="color: white;">
                Input:  Enter an Integer:
                        3
                        Enter a String:
                        Person1
            
                Output: 3 and name is Person1
                
                    </code></pre>
    <br>
    <p><b> explanation:</b> In Scanner class if we call nextLine() method after any one of the seven nextXXX() method
        then the
        nextLine() does not read values from console and cursor will not come into console it will skip that step. The
        nextXXX()
        methods are <i>nextInt(), nextFloat(), nextByte(), nextShort(), nextDouble(), nextLong(), next().</i></p>
    <p>In BufferReader class there is no such type of problem. This problem occurs only for the Scanner class, due
        to
        nextXXX()
        methods ignoring newline character and nextLine() only reads till the first newline character. If we use one
        more call
        of nextLine() method between nextXXX() and nextLine(), then this problem will not occur because nextLine()
        will
        consume
        the newline character.
    </p>

    <h2>Following are the Major Differences between Scanner and BufferedReader Class in Java</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <p>BufferedReader is synchronous while Scanner is not. BufferedReader should be used if we are working with
                multiple
                threads.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>BufferedReader has a significantly larger buffer memory than Scanner.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>The Scanner has a little buffer (1KB char buffer) as opposed to the BufferedReader (8KB byte buffer), but
                itâ€™s more than
                enough.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>BufferedReader is a bit faster as compared to scanner because the scanner does the parsing of input data
                and
                BufferedReader simply reads a sequence of characters.</p>
        </li>
    </ul>
